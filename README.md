Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amir, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UC Riverside, based in sunny Southern California ðŸŒ´

My research focuses on computational biology, with interests in genome editing (CRISPR), algorithm design, and large-scale data analysis. I build open-source tools that help make biological data more accessible, efficient, and scalable.

ðŸ§¬ Most recent projects include:
- SIRIUS â€“ (current, coming soon) efficient and optimal divergent synonymous gene design
- ALLEGRO â€“ ultra-compact CRISPR guide library design across species
- MSTMap Online â€“ performant web-server for linkage mapping, and its companion Python library
- FUGUE â€“ unified genome downloader for 2,000+ fungal species

Outside the terminal, youâ€™ll find me climbing, hiking, practicing _Deutsch_, or playing guitar ðŸŽ¸

ðŸ”¬ Letâ€™s build tools that matter.
